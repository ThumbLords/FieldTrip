# FieldTrip

Field Trip acts as a science learning resource hub and provides users with an opportunity to explore their world through a customized and accessible platform. Field Trippers can explore a variety of scientific topics to collect stamps on their passport, and work towards meeting daily challenges. Topics include Space, Earth, Natural History, and General Science. The user may customize their experience by selecting customized themes and saving resources. Users may also upload their travel photos and discoveries to the Community Photo Board to show other Field Trippers what theyâ€™ve been up to. We believe in free and open access to information. This is your Field Trip, take it wherever you want, no permission slip necessary.

# DB Schema

Type field name in the resource collections (doc, news) refers to what category it belongs to (Space, Earth, NatSci).

# Stamps

Stamps are logged in the stamps array on the User schema. A stamp function grabs an image from the image field name in the corresponding collection (Space, Earth, NatScience) and logs it to the user's passport.
