# FieldTrip


# DB Schema

Type field name in the resource collections (pod, doc, news) refers to what category it belongs to (Space, Plant, NatSci).

# Stamps

Stamps are logged in the newsSchema/ podSchema/ and docSchema. A stamp function grabs an image from the image field name in the corresponding collection (Space, Plant, NatScience) and logs it to the user's passport.

# Badges

A badge is created when a given number of properties are compiled together from a user's collection of stamps. These typically work in intervals of 10 -> 100 -> 1000.Stri
